    { q: "Is this legal?", a: "Yes. We only analyze publicly available content and respect each platform's terms of use." },
    { q: "How accurate is the transcription?", a: "We use state‑of‑the‑art models and custom cleanup. In our tests, average word error rate is below 1%." },
    { q: "What platforms do you support?", a: "Instagram (Reels, Posts, Stories), TikTok, and YouTube (Videos, Shorts). More are on the roadmap." },
    { q: "Do you store the videos?", a: "No. We process media and store transcripts, metadata, and detected insights for search and analysis." },
    { q: "Can I analyze my own content?", a: "Absolutely. Many teams use Scriptlyfy to audit their back catalog and find repeatable hooks." },
    { q: "How is my data secured?", a: "All traffic is encrypted in transit. Transcripts are encrypted at rest and access is role‑based." },
    { q: "Can I export data?", a: "CSV and JSON exports are available from any search or collection. API access is available on request." },
    { q: "What about rate limits?", a: "We implement fair‑use rate limits per account to protect performance. Enterprise limits can be increased." },
